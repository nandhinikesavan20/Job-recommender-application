In this system, we demonstrate a chatbot that uses Artificial Intelligence to produce dynamic responses to online client enquiries.
This web-based platform provides a vast intelligent base that can help humans to solve problems. 
The chatbot recognizes the user’s context, which prompts an intended response. Because this is a dynamic response, the user’s desired response will be generated.

Chatbots come to use in numerous fields of our daily life. Because AI enhances the human touch in every communication, chatbot are becoming increasingly robust. 
It triggers accurate responses after understanding a user’s query.
